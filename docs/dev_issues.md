# Ray Casting and Node Selection Implementation (2024-01-15)

## Current Implementation

### Ray Casting Pipeline
1. **Screen to World Space Transformation**
   - Convert tap coordinates to normalized device coordinates (-1 to 1)
   - Transform through clip space using inverse projection matrix
   - Transform to world space using inverse view matrix
   - Create ray from camera position in resulting direction

### Node Selection Logic
1. **Hit Testing**
   - Use sphere intersection testing with configurable hit radius
   - Hit radius scaled relative to node size (1.5x node scale)
   - Test all nodes and select closest intersection to camera

### Debug Visualization
1. **Ray Visualization**
   - White line showing ray direction
   - Cyan spheres along ray path
   - Magenta sphere at tap point projection
   - Green/red spheres showing hit testing volumes

## Current Issues

### Ray Alignment
1. **Coordinate Transformation**
   - Ray direction not perfectly aligned with tap point
   - Possible issues in projection/view matrix transformations
   - Need to verify coordinate space conversions

### Hit Detection
1. **Depth Issues**
   - Sometimes selecting nodes behind intended target
   - Need to improve closest intersection detection
   - May need to adjust hit radius based on distance

### Camera Interaction
1. **View Frustum**
   - Limited camera movement making some nodes hard to select
   - Need to improve orbit controls for better node access
   - Consider adding temporary transparency for occluded nodes

## Technical Notes

### Ray Casting Math
```swift
// Convert to NDC space
let normalizedX = (2.0 * Float(point.x) / Float(viewSize.width)) - 1.0
let normalizedY = 1.0 - (2.0 * Float(point.y) / Float(viewSize.height))

// Transform through projection
let clipCoords = SIMD4<Float>(normalizedX, normalizedY, -1.0, 1.0)
var viewCoords = invProjection * clipCoords
viewCoords = viewCoords / viewCoords.w  // Perspective divide

// Transform to world space
let worldCoords = invView * SIMD4<Float>(viewCoords.x, viewCoords.y, -1.0, 0.0)
let rayDirection = normalize(SIMD3<Float>(worldCoords.x, worldCoords.y, worldCoords.z))
```

### Intersection Testing
```swift
// Sphere intersection test
let oc = ray.origin - center
let a = dot(ray.direction, ray.direction)
let b = 2.0 * dot(oc, ray.direction)
let c = dot(oc, oc) - radius * radius
let discriminant = b * b - 4 * a * c
```

## Next Steps
